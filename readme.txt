This repository was an attempt at finding ways to break monoliths into microservices, while not having control over the monolithic source code. I tried to write a program which would take the monolith, and re-write it in a microservice-friendly way. The approach I took here was too tightly coupled with the source code, and bound to get unfeasibly messy. The next attempt I make will follow a more generalized, decoupled approach.
